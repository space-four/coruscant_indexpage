## Blog 

### Blog Entries and Images

- If blog-entry is supposed to have images, place blog-entry as `index.md` into a dir withhin respecitive sub-dir of `/content`
  - e.g. a reference-project with screenshots would be stored in `/content/porfolio/entryname/`
- Blog-Entries - be it projects or resources - need to have a featured image
  - Featured image is displayed as background of the tiles on the list pages (see list.html)
  - Featured image _must_ be referenced in entries front matter
    - See `featuredImage`
